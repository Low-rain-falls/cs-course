# Define a Python class  V2 , which represents two-dimensional vectors and 
# supports the following operations:
# -  Create a new vector out of two real numbers:  v = V2(1.1, 2.2)
# -  Convert a vector to a string (with the  __str__  method)
# -  Access the components (with the  getX  and  getY  methods)
# -  Add two  V2 s to get a new  V2  (with  add  and  __add__  methods)
# -  Multiply a  V2  by a scalar (real or int) and return a new  V2  
#   (with the  mul and  __mul__  methods)
