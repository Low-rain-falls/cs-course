==============

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duliodenis/mit-cs-courses/master/art/6-01scs11.png)

This course provides an integrated introduction to electrical engineering and computer science, taught using substantial laboratory experiments with mobile robots. The primary goal is to learn to appreciate and use the fundamental design principles of modularity and abstraction in a variety of contexts from electrical engineering and computer science.

The second goal is to demonstrate that making mathematical models of real systems can help in the design and analysis of those systems. Finally, there is the more typical goals of teaching exciting and important basic material from electrical engineering and computer science, including modern software engineering, linear systems analysis, electronic circuits, and decision-making.

Below are the problem sets for this course.
